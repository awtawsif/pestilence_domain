##### The Infested Marshes #####
The air is thick, sickly sweet with rot, and the ground oozes beneath your feet. A figure coalesces from the fever-fog—Pestilence himself.
His voice, a rasping cough, is the first thing you hear in this corrupted land.
Pestilence:
“Three paths of decay. Choose your contagion, and see what festers in you.”
He gestures, and three swirling clouds of mist form before you. Which form of decay will you embrace to begin your journey?
Path 1: Flesh — “The Rot That Breathes”
Path 2: Faith — “The Prayer of the Diseased”
Path 3: Thought — “The Whispering Fog”
You choose the path of the body, the immediate, sickening truth of physical corruption. The air grows heavier, and your own skin begins to prickle with fever.
Pestilence:
“When flesh fails, what kills first?”
1. The wound itself
2. The infection within
3. The fear of dying
You feel a subtle, painful shift in your bones, a silent acknowledgement of the unseen enemy. The path ahead is now a labyrinth of physical distress.
You choose the path of the soul, where devotion is tested by suffering, and belief becomes a form of blindness. A chorus of desperate, wheezing prayers echoes in your mind.
Pestilence:
“If healing one requires the death of ten, is it mercy?”
1. Yes, one life saved is worth it
2. No, salvation built on suffering is corruption
3. Depends on the one saved
The air tastes of ash and false hope, a weight settling on your conscience. Your path now demands sacrifice and difficult moral clarity.
You choose the path of the mind, where reality is a fever dream, and knowledge itself is a disease. The fog whispers secrets you feel compelled to believe.
Pestilence:
“Can knowledge infect?”
1. Yes, truth spreads like a plague
2. No, truth purifies
3. Only lies infect
Your vision flickers, and you question the solidity of the ground beneath you. The path ahead is a twisting maze of logic and illusion.
##### The Veins of Corruption #####
You have chosen your primary contagion. Now, the path splinters. Pestilence’s domain is a tapestry of affliction, and you must navigate the nuances of your chosen decay.
