PESTILENCE DOMAIN

🌫️ LEVEL 1 — The Infested Marshes (Choose Your Path)
INTRO
 The marsh waits like a lung gone black with smoke. Each step sinks, and the fog moves as if it breathes. From that living mist a gaunt figure rises—Pestilence, stitched of cough and shadow. His presence tastes of metal and old wine. The hush that follows is not silence but the held intake before a scream.
Pestilence:
“Three contagions. Each is a truth and a trial. Choose which rot will teach you — for knowledge here is paid in decay.”
PROMPT
 He spreads skeletal fingers, and three spirals of mist form, each bearing a different scent: iron and earth, incense and ash, and the faint hum of static thought. Which contagion will you take into your bones?

Path 1: Flesh — “The Rot That Breathes”
INTRO
 You step toward a fog that smells of damp soil and fever. The heat of disease presses at your skin, a pressure like a thousand whispered ailments. Your own heartbeat becomes a metronome counting down to erosion — not only of body but of what it anchors.
Pestilence:
“When flesh unravels, what is the first casualty — wound, weakness, or will?”
Option
The wound itself — the immediate, visible break
The infection within — the slow, unseen spread
The fear of dying — the mind that surrenders first
OUTRO
 A shiver crawls beneath your ribs. Your reflection in a puddle distorts into patched skin and hollows; the world feels tactile and unforgiving. You have begun the lesson of bodies that betray, and every step forward will be measured against the cost of survival.

Path 2: Faith — “The Prayer of the Diseased”
INTRO
 You follow a column of cold light wherein prayers hang like moths. Devotion here feels heavy—every whispered supplication weighs like a coin in a closed palm. The air tastes of burnt offerings and hope that has been ground fine by despair.
Pestilence:
“When salvation requires sacrifice, does mercy remain mercy or become currency?”
Option
Yes, one life saved is worth many lost — a necessary calculus
No, salvation spun from suffering is corrosion of the sacred
Depends on the one saved — judgement must be contextual
OUTRO
 The warmth of faith sits uneasily beneath your ribs like a candle melting on a book of law. Your path will demand choices that mark you: altar or ash, compassion or calculation. The world will test whether conviction can withstand contagion.

Path 3: Thought — “The Whispering Fog”
INTRO
 You step into a fog that murmurs in languages you know and those you've never heard. Ideas feel like viruses here — contagious, seductive, altering the shape of questions until they bite. The air tastes like old libraries and the metallic tang of revelation.
Pestilence:
“Does knowing alter the knower, or merely reveal what already festers within?”
Option
Yes, truth spreads like a plague, changing all it touches
No, truth purifies — exposure cleanses corruption
Only lies infect — falsehood is the contagion of minds
OUTRO
 Your steps are uncertain, as if logic itself fuzzes at the edges. Doubt and certainty become indistinguishable echoes. From this path, your weapon is scrutiny — but beware: too much seeing can erode the seer.

🌿 LEVEL 2 — Sub-Realms
LEVEL 2 INTRO
 The choice you made branches the swamp into strange tributaries. Pestilence watches like a cartographer of sorrow, his map inked in consequences. These sub-realms press new dilemmas into your palm — minor cruelties, desperate kindnesses, the small moral failures that expand into character.
 You must navigate these nuanced trials; the way you respond will shape the fabric of your final confrontation.

🩸 PATH OF FLESH
2.1 The Plagued Village
Narrative Setup
 The village is a chorus of broken breaths. Children thread between shrouded adults; the sick press palms to doors as if touch could tether them to life. The stench of rot hides behind every curtain, yet some faces still search your eyes for rescue.
Question Prompt
“The village is dying. The choices before you are visceral and blunt. How do you respond to a community unraveling under infection?”
Option
Heal the child — pull a single life back from the edge, but at cost to your strength
Burn the sick — end the bodies to starve the disease, sacrificing souls to save hosts
Seal the gates — isolate the blight, condemning those inside to a slow extinguishing
Outro
 Whatever you choose, the immediate pain sharpens into long echoes. Healing creates bonds and vulnerabilities; burning leaves charred memory where people once stood; sealing isolates you with the knowledge of distant cries. The path forward will be marked by the faces you could not save and those you chose to spare.

🕯️ PATH OF FAITH
2.6 The Pilgrim’s Test
Narrative Setup
 A pilgrim staggers to their knees, fever and faith braided on their lips. Their hands clutch a rosary beaded with blood and hope. You possess a single vial — the true cure, potent and finite. Its presence turns morality into mechanics: who will wield mercy, and at what price?
Question Prompt
“You carry one cure. Is your life a commodity for devotion, or does duty demand a harder choice?”
Option
Give it — act as sacrament and save another, accepting the wound you earn
Keep it — preserve your chance to continue the work, or to survive yourself
Leave them — abstain from interference, allowing fate to flow as it will
Outro
 Each option tightens a knot in your chest: charity that consumes, survival that calcifies into selfishness, or inaction that becomes indifference. Faith will be tested beyond prayer; the marrow of belief will be weighed against the hunger of self-preservation.

🧠 PATH OF THOUGHT
2.7 The Hall of Echoes
Narrative Setup
 The hall stretches endless; your past thoughts bounce and grow teeth. They repeat you, but not kindly — every sentence warps in the echo into accusation or reassurance. Time here folds; a whispered regret may become a lie you once told yourself.
Question Prompt
“In this chamber of mirrored mind, what do you do when your own thoughts turn on you?”
Option
Follow the echo — give in to the seduction of certainty it offers
Block your ears — harden against the noise and protect your inner thread
Scream back — reclaim voice, using raw emotion to break the loop
Outro
 Your reaction sculpts the interior landscape. Following binds you to a lineage of half-truths; blocking builds resilience but risks numbness; screaming reclaims agency but invites chaos. The mental patterns you reinforce will come with you to the final gate.

🌑 LEVEL 3 — FINAL SUB-BRANCHES (ALL PATHS)
LEVEL 3 INTRO
 The swamp thins to a threshold: a gate of bristling reeds and the hollow glare of Pestilence. Behind each door is the consequence of your previous acts. These final trials demand you answer the question you've been steering toward since the first breath of rot — will you be remade by what you carried, or consumed?

🩸 PATH OF FLESH — FINAL TESTS
3.1 Plagued Village → Heal the Child
Narrative Setup
 The child you saved coughs wetly into your palm; the infection has leapt in recompense. Your veins hum with cold fire. To move forward you must accept that compassion can wound the compassionate.
Question Prompt
“The child lives, but the contagion sleeps within you now. Do you press onward bearing this burden?”
Option
Yes — carry the rot as a badge and press on
No — surrender to care or to the rot and stop here
Outro: You push forward, body thin as paper but heart stubborn as bone. The infection becomes a tutor: you learn endurance and the anatomy of sacrifice.

3.2 Plagued Village → Burn the Sick
Narrative Setup
 Flames take the sick with the crack and roar of decisive violence. The air fills with ashes and lost names. In the wake of the blaze, only bones and scorched earth remain.
Question Prompt
“Do you stay to help organize the ashes — to name the dead and give them what dignity remains — or do you flee the scenes you helped create?”
Option
Stay to help — bear witness, catalog sorrow, try to restore human order
Flee — escape the weight, sparing yourself the stain of remembrance
Outro: The acrid smoke stings memory; whether you remain or run, the embers of your choice follow like a ghost. Conscience and pragmatism will shape the last confrontations.

3.3 Plagued Village → Seal the Gates
Narrative Setup
 You shut the bolts on the village, the hinges whining like small graves closing. The lamplight inside wanes; through cracks you hear muffled pleading. The world beyond keeps breathing, but you have left a pocket of silence to grow.
Question Prompt
“In the quiet behind the sealed gate, which feeling anchors you?”
Option
Relief — the pragmatic cold calculus of safety
Guilt — the long, corrosive ache of chosen exile
Outro: The sealed air replays choices like a metronome. Isolation preserves some lives and damns others; you move forward bearing the ledger of what you decided could not be saved.

🕯️ PATH OF FAITH — FINAL TESTS

3.16 Pilgrim’s Test → Give Cure
Narrative Setup
 The pilgrim clutches life anew; their thanks is a thin, pleading sound. The cure's price is etched into your flesh — infection or exhaustion, a mark that your mercy had a toll.
Question Prompt
“Can you endure the cost your compassion has demanded? Will your faith sustain you beneath this new weight?”
Option
Endure — bend but do not break under the cross of consequence
Collapse — admit that even saints can snap when burdened
Outro: The world tests whether mercy is an unending well. Endurance reshapes you into a figure of sacrificial authority; collapse teaches limits that can be as humane as heroism.

3.17 Pilgrim’s Test → Keep Cure
Narrative Setup
 You keep the vial as a promise to yourself: a future safeguard, a bargaining chip against fate. The pilgrim dies or survives by some other hand. Guilt nests in small, invasive ways.
Question Prompt
“Do you let shame fester quietly, or do you carry it as a lesson that sharpens you?”
Option
Forget — bury the memory and continue functioning
Remember — let the memory refine your choices and humble you
Outro: Retaining the cure alters the ledger of your spirit. To forget is to harden; to remember is to keep your conscience as a lodestar for harder trials ahead.

3.18 Pilgrim’s Test → Leave
Narrative Setup
 You turn away as the pilgrim’s body is borne by the river. The current takes what you will not touch. A small ripple spreads outward — your inaction has a geometry.
Question Prompt
“Do you offer a final kindness even in absence — a whispered prayer or an indifferent step?”
Option
Pray — bestow a private benediction and meet your inaction with ritual
Ignore — hold to detachment as a doctrine of survival
Outro: Even leaving is an act with texture. Prayer gives meaning to absence; ignoring nails the lid of practicality shut. Both shape the soul you bring into the final reckoning.

🧠 PATH OF THOUGHT — FINAL TESTS
3.19 Hall of Echoes → Follow
Narrative Setup
 Your younger self steps forward, naïve and accusing in equal measure. The echo offers easy absolution or dangerous nostalgia.
Question Prompt
“Is the past self a key you should welcome, or a chain you must break?”
Option
Embrace — integrate past mistakes as the scaffolding of wisdom
Reject — sever ties and attempt a new, unburdened path
Outro: Integration mends fractures into new forms; rejection risks repeating the past in new colors. Wisdom here becomes the ability to hold both pain and lesson together.

3.20 Hall of Echoes → Block Ears
Narrative Setup
 You attempt to silence the hall. Silence is not simple absence but a pressure that rearranges thought. Internal rhythms press louder when the world is shut out.
Question Prompt
“Do you accept this internal cadence as part of you, or do you panic at its insistence?”
Option
Listen — learn the rhythm and allow it to become guidance
Panic — fracture under the unbearable mirror of the mind
Outro: Acceptance grants a steadier center; panic scatters perception. The mind you steady here will either be a fortress or a house of cards in the final trial.

3.21 Hall of Echoes → Scream Back
Narrative Setup
 You answer the echoes with a raw, human sound that ripples the hall into new harmonics. The choir rearranges, finding patterns you force upon it.
Question Prompt
“What response holds the most sanity in the face of overwhelming noise?”
Option
Keep screaming — let catharsis and continued force shape the environment
Laugh — use absurdity to unmask the terror the echoes weave
Outro: Both fury and laughter can be sanity’s armor; you learn to use voice as a tool rather than a victim of echo.

🕯️ GRAND OUTRO
Final Scene
 The fog lifts as if someone had skimmed a hand across a mirror. Pestilence stands before you, less a judge now and more a final instructor. His gaze catalogs the paths taken, the lives touched, the silences left, and the aberrant reason you carried like a hidden wound.
Pestilence:
“Thirty-nine breaths of corruption — measured, learned, and earned. Will you rise, bearing the mark that proves you understood decay, or will you remain rooted in what you feared?”
SUCCESS (≥2 correct per path)
“You wear my mark not as punishment, but as a sigil of understanding. You discovered that corruption can be translated into wisdom: compassion tempered with realism, faith tempered with consequence, thought tempered with humility. Go forward; you are marked, sharpened, and dangerous in the best sense.”
FAILURE (<2 correct per path)
“You are unripe — the infection has not yet taught you. Return to the marshes to fester and learn; only through suffering and reflection will the hard fruit of wisdom form. Come back when you can offer more than instinct.”
