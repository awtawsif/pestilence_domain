PESTILENCE DOMAIN

🌫️ LEVEL 1 — The Infested Marshes (Choose Your Path)
INTRO
 The air is thick, sickly sweet with rot, and the ground oozes beneath your feet. A figure coalesces from the fever-fog—Pestilence himself. His voice, a rasping cough, is the first thing you hear in this corrupted land.
Pestilence:
“Three paths of decay. Choose your contagion, and see what festers in you.”
PROMPT
 He gestures, and three swirling clouds of mist form before you. Which form of decay will you embrace to begin your journey?

Path 1: Flesh — “The Rot That Breathes”
INTRO
 You choose the path of the body, the immediate, sickening truth of physical corruption. The air grows heavier, and your own skin begins to prickle with fever.
Pestilence:
“When flesh fails, what kills first?”
Option
The wound itself
The infection within
The fear of dying

OUTRO
 You feel a subtle, painful shift in your bones, a silent acknowledgement of the unseen enemy. The path ahead is now a labyrinth of physical distress.

Path 2: Faith — “The Prayer of the Diseased”
INTRO
 You choose the path of the soul, where devotion is tested by suffering, and belief becomes a form of blindness. A chorus of desperate, wheezing prayers echoes in your mind.
Pestilence:
“If healing one requires the death of ten, is it mercy?”
Option
Yes, one life saved is worth it
No, salvation built on suffering is corruption
Depends on the one saved

OUTRO
 The air tastes of ash and false hope, a weight settling on your conscience. Your path now demands sacrifice and difficult moral clarity.

Path 3: Thought — “The Whispering Fog”
INTRO
 You choose the path of the mind, where reality is a fever dream, and knowledge itself is a disease. The fog whispers secrets you feel compelled to believe.
Pestilence:
“Can knowledge infect?”
Option
Yes, truth spreads like a plague
No, truth purifies
Only lies infect

OUTRO
 Your vision flickers, and you question the solidity of the ground beneath you. The path ahead is a twisting maze of logic and illusion.

🌿 LEVEL 2 — Sub-Realms
LEVEL 2 INTRO
 You have chosen your primary contagion. Now, the path splinters. Pestilence’s domain is a tapestry of affliction, and you must navigate the nuances of your chosen decay.

🩸 PATH OF FLESH
2.1 The Plagued Village
Narrative Setup
 The villagers cough and bleed; eyes pleading as they crawl toward you. They are beyond saving, yet their suffering is a raw, painful plea.
Question Prompt
“You have one vial of cure, enough for half. Who do you save?”
Option
The young
The wise
Randomly

Outro
 You made your decision. Now the surviving half of the village, newly saved or left to die, will define your final confrontation with the consequences of your action.

2.2 The Rotting Tree
Narrative Setup
 The forest here is a single, cancerous organism. Roots pulse beneath your feet, black sap bubbling like tar from a giant, twisted tree.
Question Prompt
“Four vines strangle the roots. One is life, fighting to sustain the rot. Which do you cut to stop the infection?”
Option
Vine of Blood
Vine of Ash
Vine of Glass

Hint: “Even decay has a pulse.”
Outro
 You sever the vine. The ground shakes, and the consequence of this violent act of intervention awaits in the next stage of the rot.

2.3 The Broken Mirror
Narrative Setup
 In a forgotten marsh pool, a shattered piece of glass reflects you. You see your reflection smiling when you do not, its eyes dark and mocking.
Question Prompt
“What happens when you shatter your reflection, a perfect image of the self?”
Option
You’re free
You break yourself
The reflection escapes

Outro
 The reflection now understands your intent. Its broken fragments will serve as the eyes through which you face your final trial in this path of flesh.

🕯️ PATH OF FAITH
2.4 The False Prophet
Narrative Setup
 A man preaches healing to a crowd of the suffering—his touch spreads boils, his followers cheer. They find solace in the shared, divine pain.
Question Prompt
“His lies offer comfort, his truth brings death. Do you expose him to the desperate crowd?”
Option
Yes
No
Join him

Outro
 Your choice rings out. Whether you spoke or stayed silent, the Prophet's fate, and the crowd's devotion, will dictate the nature of your final moral challenge.

2.5 The Diseased Idol
Narrative Setup
 An idol of carved bone stands central in a shrine. It leaks black, oily tears, and the kneeling villagers pray in blissful, unquestioning rot.
Question Prompt
“This is devotion to the plague itself. Do you act to save their souls from this false deity?”
Option
Destroy it
Worship it
Wash it clean

Outro
 The consequences of interfering with their worship are immediate. Your final encounter is now shaped by whether you protected or desecrated their belief.

2.6 The Pilgrim’s Test
Narrative Setup
 A pilgrim collapses before you, pustules covering their skin. They gasp out a prayer. You carry one dose of the true cure—enough for them, or for you.
Question Prompt
“You carry one cure. Is your life or the purity of your devotion more valuable right now? What do you do?”
Option
Give it
Keep it
Leave them

Outro
 The choice is made—a life given or a life taken. Your final test will be defined by the burden of this choice: the darkness in your veins, or the weight in your conscience.

🧠 PATH OF THOUGHT
2.7 The Hall of Echoes
Narrative Setup
 The Hall is vast and empty. The air repeats your every thought—each echo louder, more twisted, and more accusatory than the last.
Question Prompt
“In this din of self-condemnation, which internal voice do you silence first to regain control?”
Option
The voice of guilt
The voice of fear
The voice of doubt

Outro
 The chosen voice fades, but the others remain. Your final mental confrontation will be dictated by the nature of the remaining internal struggle.

2.8 The Whispering Book
Narrative Setup
 A large, leather-bound tome hums softly on a pedestal, its words writhing on the page. Its promise is grand, its price terrifying.
Question Prompt
“Its pages promise cure for all madness but warn that the enlightenment will blind the reader to the real world. Do you read it?”
Option
Yes
No
Burn it

Outro
 The decision is made. The nature of the book's power—opened, closed, or destroyed—will create the logic puzzle for your final test.

2.9 The Forgotten Dream
Narrative Setup
 You dream of curing the world, a perfect, logical plan unfolding—but you wake with your mind hollowed out, the memory of the plan gone. The choice is stark.
Question Prompt
“Would you trade all memory, all understanding of the self, for the salvation of the world?”
Option
Yes
No
Forget the dream

Outro
 Your choice on memory vs. reality is the foundation of your final struggle. The path ahead is one of either perfect awareness or blissful forgetting.


🌑 LEVEL 3 — FINAL SUB-BRANCHES (ALL PATHS)
LEVEL 3 INTRO
 You stand at the final gate, having faced the heart of your chosen decay. The choices ahead will test not only your intellect and morality, but the resilience of your very self.
