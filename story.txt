##### The Infested Marshes #####
The air is thick, sickly sweet with rot, and the ground oozes beneath your feet. A figure coalesces from the fever-fog—Pestilence himself.
His voice, a rasping cough, is the first thing you hear in this corrupted land.
Pestilence:
“Three paths of decay. Choose your contagion, and see what festers in you.”
He gestures, and three swirling clouds of mist form before you. Which form of decay will you embrace to begin your journey?
Path 1: Flesh — “The Rot That Breathes”
Path 2: Faith — “The Prayer of the Diseased”
Path 3: Thought — “The Whispering Fog”
You choose the path of the body, the immediate, sickening truth of physical corruption. The air grows heavier, and your own skin begins to prickle with fever.
Pestilence:
“When flesh fails, what kills first?”
1. The wound itself
2. The infection within
3. The fear of dying
You feel a subtle, painful shift in your bones, a silent acknowledgement of the unseen enemy. The path ahead is now a labyrinth of physical distress.
You choose the path of the soul, where devotion is tested by suffering, and belief becomes a form of blindness. A chorus of desperate, wheezing prayers echoes in your mind.
Pestilence:
“If healing one requires the death of ten, is it mercy?”
1. Yes, one life saved is worth it
2. No, salvation built on suffering is corruption
3. Depends on the one saved
The air tastes of ash and false hope, a weight settling on your conscience. Your path now demands sacrifice and difficult moral clarity.
You choose the path of the mind, where reality is a fever dream, and knowledge itself is a disease. The fog whispers secrets you feel compelled to believe.
Pestilence:
“Can knowledge infect?”
1. Yes, truth spreads like a plague
2. No, truth purifies
3. Only lies infect
Your vision flickers, and you question the solidity of the ground beneath you. The path ahead is a twisting maze of logic and illusion.
##### The Veins of Corruption #####
You have chosen your primary contagion. Now, the path splinters. Pestilence’s domain is a tapestry of affliction, and you must navigate the nuances of your chosen decay.

🩸 PATH OF FLESH
2.1 The Plagued Village

Burn the sick
Seal the gates
Outro
The village falls silent, its fate sealed by your hand. Whether through sacrifice, fire, or isolation, you have chosen your method of containment, and the consequences will scar the path ahead.

Narrative Setup
The forest here is a single, cancerous organism. Roots pulse beneath your feet, black sap bubbling like tar from a giant, twisted tree.

Option
Vine of Blood
Vine of Ash
Vine of Glass

In a forgotten marsh pool, a shattered piece of glass reflects you. You see your reflection smiling when you do not, its eyes dark and mocking.

2.5 The Diseased Idol
Narrative Setup
An idol of carved bone stands central in a shrine. It leaks black, oily tears, and the kneeling villagers pray in blissful, unquestioning rot.

“This is devotion to the plague itself. Do you act to save their souls from this false deity?”
Option
Destroy it
Worship it
Cleanse it
Outro
The heavy air of the shrine shifts. The idol stands or falls by your command, marking you as either a destroyer of false gods, a servant of their decay, or a fool trying to wash away the un-washable.

2.6 The Pilgrim’s Test
Narrative Setup
A pilgrim collapses before you, pustules covering their skin. They gasp out a prayer. You carry one dose of the true cure—enough for them, or for you.

Option
Give it
Keep it
Leave them

2.7 The Hall of Echoes
Narrative Setup

Option
Read the book
Burn the book
Seal the book
Outro
The book's fate is sealed. Whether its knowledge is consumed, destroyed, or buried, the truth it holds (or hides) now defines the boundaries of your sanity.

2.9 The Forgotten Dream
Narrative Setup
You dream of curing the world, a perfect, logical plan unfolding—but you wake with your mind hollowed out, the memory of the plan gone. The choice is stark.
Question Prompt
“Would you trade all memory, all understanding of the self, for the salvation of the world?”
Option
Chase the dream
Wake up
Let fog consume you
Outro
The dream dissolves or solidifies based on your will. You step forward, carrying the residue of either harsh reality, seductive oblivion, or total dissolution.
